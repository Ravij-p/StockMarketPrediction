# Stock Market Prediction Using LSTM
by Ravij Patel and Diya shah
## Overview
This project focuses on predicting stock market prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The aim is to leverage machine learning techniques to analyze historical stock prices and forecast future price movements.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Collect historical stock price data from reliable sources.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data for model training.
- **LSTM Model**: Implement and train LSTM neural networks for prediction.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the predictions against actual stock prices.
- **Optimization**: Fine-tune the model for better accuracy.

### Work in Progress
- **Model Optimization**: Further tuning hyperparameters for improved accuracy.
- **Deployment**: Deploying the model as a web application for real-time predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Data Collection: pandas, yfinance
  - Data Preprocessing: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
  - Model Building: TensorFlow, Keras
  - Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code
